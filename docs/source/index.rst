========================
Zabbix module for Python
========================


This set of modules allows you to work with Zabbix in Python.

Currently it contains:
    * :ref:`pyzabbix.api<zabbix.api>` for working with the Zabbix API.
    * :ref:`pyzabbix.sender<zabbix.sender>` for sending metrics to Zabbix.

.. note:: `py-zabbix` does not require additional modules, it uses only standard
    Python modules.
