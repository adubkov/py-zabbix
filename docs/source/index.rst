Welcome to py-zabbix's documentation!

========================
Zabbix module for Python
========================


That set of modules allow to work with Zabbix in Python.

Currently it contains:
    * :ref:`zabbix.api<zabbix.api>` for work with Zabbix API.
    * :ref:`zabbix.sender<zabbix.sender>` for send metrics to Zabbix.

.. note:: Those modules do not require addition modules, they use standard
    Python modules.
